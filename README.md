# SampleContainerView
The container view controllers provide a way to developers to combine the content from multiple iOS view controllers in a single user interface of iOS app. In fact, the custom container can be easily edited with editor of XCode.
Here, I’ve created a demo on [Implementing iOS Container View To Create Reusable Components In iPhone App](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/ios-container-view-example-tutorial/). 

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS App and looking to [Hire iPhone App Developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-iphone-developer/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
